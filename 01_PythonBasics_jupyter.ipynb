However, if you're searching for a new career in data science, you need to consider the adoption level of a programming language in this world. As a programming language developed by a Dutch programmer named **Guido Van Rossum**, Python is the king of the data science arena as being the most used language in this area. \n",

    "- Python is a language that is easy to learn and write with its clear and comprehensible syntax. Writing code, like speaking English, is an enjoyable job!\n",
    "- Python has a fantastic data science ecosystem. For every need you can think of, you can find a Python library. Python's open-source tools have an impressive ecosystem in many scientific areas.\n",
    "- According to many studies, Python is one of the fastest-growing languages in the world. Take a look at the TIOBE index's October 2019 data:"
